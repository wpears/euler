2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Easy. No programming. the LCM of a range of numbers is the product of the prime factors of the range to their highest multiple... so for 1-20 it is all the primes (11^1, eg) times 3^2 times 2^4. Since these numbers have a greater quantity of these primes than any other number in the set, they encompass the other numbers' requirements

Simply put, the LCM must have in its prime factorization the prime factorization of each number in the range individually, but no more.
